# Sampling_Assignment_1

Here is the discussion part  and my observations from this sample assignment1->
The highest accuracy is seen in sample 5 with a value of 1.000000 for Gradient Boosting. This  indicates overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but might not generalize well to  unseen data.the next best result is 0.983607, which is  achieved across different samples and models.Sample 1 and Sample 2 both perform best with Gradient Boosting, while Sample 4 shows strong results with both Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting.

# Best Model for each sample:
Sample 1: Gradient Boosting
Sample 2: Gradient Boosting
Sample 3: Logistic Regression
Sample 4: Decision Tree / Gradient Boosting
Sample 5: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
